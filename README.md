**What are microservices in web development?**

In the fast-paced world of web development, the approach to building applications has undergone a significant transformation. One of the most notable changes in recent years is the adoption of microservices. This architectural style has gained immense popularity for its ability to create scalable, maintainable, and highly efficient web applications. In this blog, we’ll explore the realm of microservices in web development, from what they are to why they matter and how they are reshaping the development landscape.

**Understanding Monolithic vs. Microservices**
Before we dive into the world of microservices, it’s crucial to understand the conventional monolithic approach to web development. Traditionally, web applications were built as monoliths. In a monolithic architecture, an entire application is constructed as a single, interconnected unit. This includes the user interface, server-side logic, and the database, all bundled together within a single codebase.

While monolithic applications are simple to set up and develop in the early stages of a project, they face challenges as they grow. Any changes or updates to one part of the application can potentially disrupt the entire system. This complexity makes maintenance and scaling difficult in monolithic architectures.
